CH5120; Modern Control Theory; IITM; MPC implementation; MATLAB

This is my repository for the capstone project for CH5120.

There are two implementations, brute force with fmincon, and QP with quadprog.
Obviously QP takes advantage of the problem formulation to give faster solutions.

Use config.m to input the parameters, run.
